# STAgent
## Overview  
STAgent is a multimodal large language model (LLM)-based AI agent that automates...


## Features  
- **End-to-End Automation** –   
- **Multimodal Interaction** – Supports text, voice, and image-based inputs.  
- **Autonomous Reasoning** – Uses LLMs and coding functions to optimize sorting without human intervention.  
- **Interpretable Results** – Generates detailed reports explaining sorting decisions.  

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/LiuLab-Bioelectronics-Harvard/STAgent.git
   cd STAgent
   ```

2. Install the dependencies

   We use conda to manage the dependencies and currently only support the Linux system.

   ### Linux Users

   ```bash
   # Create the environment from the file
   conda env create -f environment.linux.yml
   
   # Activate the environment
   conda activate stagent
   ```

3. Set up your environment variables
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory
   - Add your API key in this file. The API keys needed for this agent are:
    ```
    # If you want to use OpenAI models, you need to add the following:
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
    OPENAI_API_BASE=your-api-base-here
    WHISPER_API_KEY=your-whisper-api-key-here

    # If you want to use Claude, you need to add the following:
    ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-anthropic-api-key-here

    # If you want to use Gemini, you need to add the following:
    GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-google-api-key-here
    ```

4. (Optional) Modify the default parameters in `src/Agent/default.py`
    
    You may also directly share parameters with the agent and our agent will set them for you. 

5. Run the app
   ```bash
   streamlit run src/unified_app.py
   ```

The app will open in your default web browser at the local host.

## Usage
1. `src`: this directory contains the source code of the STAgent.
2. `data`: this directory can be used to hold the data. You can unzip the data files and testing with our agent.
3. `src/tmp/plots`: this directory contains the plots generated by the agent.
4. `conversation_histories_{model}`: these directories contains the conversation history of the agent classfied by the model used. You may load and save the conversation history with the agent.
